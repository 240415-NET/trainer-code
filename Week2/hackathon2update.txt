In this Hackathon we want to create a C# console application with the following requirments.

1 - Create a Class to model some sort of object
1 - Prompt the user for values for that object
2 - Use these values to create objects that we define (maybe use a Constructor?)
3 - We want to store these objects in a List (or Array)
3 - Handles any exceptions that may arise during the running of the application (no hard crashing)
4 - We want to be able to manage and update the values for our objects stored in the list
5 - Continues to run until the user quits the application, from within the application (no ctrl+c)


The goal of this application is to create, manipulate and modify an array of a consistent data types.

An potential example you can use is a grocery list, that a user can add items to, and then update if they have bought it or not.
