In this Hackathon we want to create a C# console application with the following requirments.

1 - Prompts the user for multiple values
2 - Save the values to an Array
3 - Handles any exceptions that may arise during the running of the application (no hard crashing)
4 - Manage and update the values for the array using inputs from the User
5 - Continues to run until the user quits the application, from within the application (no ctrl+c)

The goal of this application is to create, manipulate and modify an array of a consistent data types.

An potential example you can use is a grocery list, that a user can add items to, and then update if they have bought it or not.
