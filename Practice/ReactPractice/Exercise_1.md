# Exercise 1 - Components

## Description

This exercise involves the creation of a component that will display basic HTML content to the page. The component will have a CSS file associated with it, that will allow the component to be styled.

## Approach

1. Create a new function React TSX Component called "ComponentOne".
2. The component should have some HTML in its return
3. Display the component to the web page using the `App.tsx`
4. Style the component using a separate CSS file

## Hints

- The component is focused purely on displaying data, it is fine to hard code in values just to display information
- The component should be a functional component and it needs to be exported, use the snippet `rfce` to generate the boiler plate for you
- The component needs to be imported into your `App.tsx` and written like an HTML element
