I want to... 

- Create a C# Console App
- User interactions through the console with exception handling
- Single User
- Persist data to a local file on my machine* 
- Separate things into 3-4 Layers

Application Ideas

- Home Inventory/Receipt tracker (More code)
	- Accounts for more than one user's stuff
	- Different categories of items (Furniture, Clothes, etc)
		- Storing the original value of the items
		- description 
		- Date of Purchase on the items 


(Saving this for later)
- Drivers on auto policies (Less classes/models, but we have to account for relationships.)
	- Individual policy objects/info (One to many)
	- Drivers associated with that policy


Track My Stuff! 

- Models (What are we trying to store/work with)
	- User
		- userId (int)
		- userName (string)

	- Item - Things Common to most/all item types (This is our parent/super class)
		- itemId (int/maybe guid)
		- ownerId (int referencing someone's userId)
		- item category (string)
		- Original Cost	(double)
		- Purchaes Date (DateTime) 
		- Description (string)

	
	- Pets - inherit/extends our base Item class
		- name (string)
		- species (string)
		- age (int)
	
	- Documents - inherit/extends our base Item class
		- Document Type (string)
		- Expiration Date (DateTime)
