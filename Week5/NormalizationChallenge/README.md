# Normalization Challenge

## Using any resources and working with your groups, attempt to normaliize the data in the included file (use the excel file and make your life easier)

-- The data is not formatted.  
-- Normalization should not result in any loss of data.  
-- Data should be brought into 3rd Normal Form.  
-- You may use any resources you have or find.  
-- You must perform the normalization, you may not use any automation that you did not build yourself.
