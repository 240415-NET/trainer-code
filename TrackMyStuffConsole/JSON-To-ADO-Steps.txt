Converting User storage from JSON to a SQL Database!

Set Up:
	1. Make sure our SQL Server can accept TCP/IP (That was that computer managment utility stuff we did.) - DONE
	2. We want to create a text file for our connection string. - DONE, placed outside the repo in connstring.txt
	3. We want to place that text file, in a location that makes sense. - DONE
		- We either want to place it *outside* of the repository.
		- OR, we want to add it to the .gitignore, commit and push the change to the .gitignore, 
			THEN, we create the file. 


In our Datbase:
	1. Create a database for our Application (In this case, TrackMyStuff.) - DONE
	2. Create the User table, with all associated columns and matching data types. - DONE
	2. Use the database name in our connection string to be able to log in. - DONE



In our Code:
	1. Read that connection string from whatever file we stored it in. - DONE
	2. Run the dotnet command needed to pull the  System.Data.SqlClient package into our repo.
		- dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient
	3. Use ADO.NET to create users and log them in (This will be expanded on, in demo.)
