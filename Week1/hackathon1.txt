In this Hackathon we want to create a C# console application with the following requirments.

1 - Prompts the user for some input
2 - Does something with that input
3 - Handles any exceptions that may arise during the running of the application (no hard crashing)
4 - Continues to run until the user quits the application, from within the application (no ctrl+c)
