In this Hackathon we want to create a C# console application with the following requirments.

1 - Prompts the user for some input
2 - Does something with that input
3 - Handles any exceptions that may arise during the running of the application (no hard crashing)
4 - Continues to run until the user quits the application, from within the application (no ctrl+c)

We also want to make sure this code is visible to all of us! Have someone share their screen and 
type for the group, making sure that they are inside of their personal repo on this organization. 

We want to then push this code up before we leave today. I will compile links to their repo's and 
make a teams post with links to the different groups' work for future reference.
