//This will be our javascript file
//It is attached to our HTML file via a script tag at the bottom of the body element.

//So, first we have to wait for the DOM to fully finish loading. 
//Inside of our javascript file, we can reference all the HTML (and the DOM structure) of
//our index.html, using the "document" object. We don't have to instantiate it or create it or anything,
//we can just start using it

//We reference our document object, then use dot notation to run a function to add an event listener.
//The event we are going to listen for, is 'DOMContentLoaded'.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    




}); //Closing the addEventListener method
