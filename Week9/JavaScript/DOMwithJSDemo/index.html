    <!-- We usually put scripts tags at the bottom of the body, so that they are loaded in last.
     In our javascript we will take steps to ensure that our script file waits until all of the HTML
     content is loaded. Putting the script file at the bottom can decrease load times in complex pages 
     with alot of content. -->
