# Project 1

## Overview (Due: 5/24/24 Friday)

For this individual project, you'll create a console application, where the application will be interacting with users via terminal. The project will conclude with a 5 minute presentation of working software to trainers and colleagues. Your code will be hosted on your personal repository on our class's Github Organization.

## Requirements

- The application should be a C# Console Application
- The application should build and run
- The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
- The application should allow for multiple users to log in and persist their data
- The application should demonstrate good input validation
- The application should persist data to a SQL Server DB
- The application should communicate to DB via ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core


## Nice to Have

- n-tier architecture
- dependency injection
- The application should log errors and system events to a file or a DB table
- Basic user authentication and authorization (admins vs normal users with passwords)
- The application should have unit tests

## For Monday 5/6/24

- Push a folder to your personal GitHub repository on the organization with the console app created (dotnet new console)
- Upload a .txt or .md file to your personal github repo titled "Project1Proposal" or something like that.
