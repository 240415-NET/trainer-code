# C# Fundamentals

Hello! This document will serve as a list of topics that we will attempt to cover during this training, beyond the generic topics listed that are currently visible to us. Don't panic! It looks like a lot, but we will go over examples in code (that can also be found in this trainer-code repo!)

Some of these topics will have hyperlinks pointing to the official Microsoft documentation for C# (and other technologies we might cover!) You can feel free to use this as the basis for your self directed study, but really any resources you may find are fine.
